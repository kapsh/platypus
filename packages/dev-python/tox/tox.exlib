SUMMARY="virtualenv-based automation of test activities"
DESCRIPTION="tox is a generic virtualenv management and test command line tool you can use for:
- checking your package installs correctly with different Python versions and interpreters
- running your tests in each of the environments, configuring your test tool of choice
- acting as a frontend to Continuous Integration servers,
greatly reducing boilerplate and merging CI and shell-based testing.
